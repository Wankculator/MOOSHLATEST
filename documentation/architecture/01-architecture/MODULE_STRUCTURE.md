# MOOSH Wallet - Module Structure

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The MOOSH Wallet has been refactored into a professional modular architecture with the following structure:

```
public/js/
├── src/
│   ├── app.js              # Main application entry point
│   ├── components/         # Reusable UI components
│   │   └── Button.js       # Professional button component
│   ├── utils/              # Utility modules
│   │   ├── ElementFactory.js    # DOM creation utilities
│   │   └── ResponsiveUtils.js   # Responsive design utilities
│   ├── services/           # Business logic services
│   │   └── BitcoinService.js    # Bitcoin operations abstraction
│   └── core/               # Core application systems
│       └── EventBus.js     # State management & events
└── moosh-wallet.js         # Legacy monolithic file (deprecated)
```

## 📦 Module Descriptions

### 1. **app.js** - Main Application
- Entry point for the entire application
- Initializes all services and components
- Manages view routing (landing → dashboard)
- Handles global application state

### 2. **components/Button.js**
- Reusable button component with variants (primary, secondary, danger, ghost)
- Supports different sizes (small, medium, large)
- Built-in loading states and animations
- Touch-optimized with 48px minimum height
- Fully accessible with keyboard support

### 3. **utils/ElementFactory.js**
- Professional DOM creation pattern (similar to React.createElement)
- Chainable API for building UI elements
- Type-safe attribute handling
- Event delegation support

### 4. **utils/ResponsiveUtils.js**
- Breakpoint management (xs → xxxl)
- Device detection (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Dynamic scaling factors
- Viewport change events
- Touch device detection

### 5. **services/BitcoinService.js**
- Abstraction layer for Bitcoin operations
- Ready for bitcoinjs-lib integration
- Supports all address types (Taproot, SegWit, Legacy)
- Mock implementations for UI testing
- Transaction creation/signing/broadcasting

### 6. **core/EventBus.js**
- Centralized event system
- State management with subscriptions
- Batch state updates
- Predefined events (wallet, transaction, UI, network)
- Type-safe state keys

## 🚀 Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Modularity**: Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Maintainability**: Easy to locate and update specific features
3. **Scalability**: Simple to add new components and services
4. **Testing**: Each module can be unit tested independently
5. **Performance**: Modules can be lazy-loaded as needed
6. **Type Safety**: Clear interfaces between modules

## 🔄 Migration from Legacy Code

The original `moosh-wallet.js` (12,441 lines) has been broken down into:
- 6 focused modules
- Average module size: ~200-300 lines
- Clear separation of concerns
- No more monolithic code blocks

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Add More Components**:
   - WalletCard.js
   - TransactionList.js
   - AddressDisplay.js
   - QRCode.js

2. **Expand Services**:
   - StorageService.js (encrypted localStorage)
   - NetworkService.js (API communications)
   - SecurityService.js (password/encryption)

3. **Implement Features**:
   - Mnemonic backup/restore flow
   - Send/Receive modals
   - Transaction history
   - Settings management

4. **Add Build Process**:
   - Bundle modules with Webpack/Rollup
   - Minification for production
   - Source maps for debugging

## 📝 Usage Example

```javascript
// Import what you need
import { createButton } from './components/Button.js';
import { bitcoinService } from './services/BitcoinService.js';
import { eventBus, Events } from './core/EventBus.js';

// Create UI elements
const sendButton = createButton({
    text: 'Send Bitcoin',
    variant: 'primary',
    onClick: async () => {
        const tx = await bitcoinService.createTransaction({...});
        eventBus.emit(Events.TRANSACTION_CREATED, tx);
    }
});

// Listen for events
eventBus.on(Events.WALLET_CREATED, (wallet) => {
    console.log('New wallet:', wallet);
});
```
