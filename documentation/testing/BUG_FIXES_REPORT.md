# üêõ MOOSH Wallet Bug Fixes Report

## Summary
All critical bugs identified during testing have been fixed. The wallet is now functioning correctly with all tests passing.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ‚úÖ API Custom Path Endpoint (FIXED)
**Issue**: TypeError - `root.derivePath is not a function` and publicKey type mismatch
**Root Cause**: 
- @scure/bip32 uses `derive()` method instead of `derivePath()`
- bitcoinjs-lib expects Buffer objects but @scure/bip32 returns Uint8Array

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// Changed from:
const child = root.derivePath(fullPath);

// To:
const child = root.derive(fullPath);

// And wrapped all publicKey usages with Buffer.from():
pubkey: Buffer.from(child.publicKey)
```

**Result**: Custom path derivation now works correctly, generating proper addresses for wallet detection.

### 2. ‚úÖ Address Generation (PREVIOUSLY FIXED)
**Issue**: Missing addresses after account creation/import
**Fix**: Enhanced error handling and multiple fallback paths for address extraction
**Result**: All 5 address types generate immediately without manual intervention

### 3. ‚úÖ Fix Addresses Button (PREVIOUSLY FIXED)  
**Issue**: Users needed to manually click button to fix missing addresses
**Fix**: Removed button and implemented automatic address fixing on account load
**Result**: Seamless user experience with no manual fixes required

### 4. ‚úÖ Module Import Error (PREVIOUSLY FIXED)
**Issue**: 'micro-ed25519-hdkey' module not found
**Fix**: Changed to '@scure/bip32' which is already installed
**Result**: API server starts without errors

## Test Results After Fixes

```
üìä Test Summary
Total Tests: 7
‚úÖ Passed: 7
‚ùå Failed: 0
‚ö†Ô∏è  Warnings: 1 (false positive - no actual Fix Addresses references found)
```

All tests are now passing:
- ‚úÖ API Health Check
- ‚úÖ Wallet Generation  
- ‚úÖ Custom Path Derivation
- ‚úÖ Import with Detection
- ‚úÖ Frontend Load
- ‚úÖ JavaScript Integration
- ‚úÖ External API Access

## Next Steps

With all bugs fixed, we can now proceed with:
1. Fix state persistence for accounts (Phase 0 completion)
2. Implement multi-wallet UI components (Phase 1)
3. Build wallet selection interface (Phase 2)

The foundation is now solid and ready for multi-wallet features!
