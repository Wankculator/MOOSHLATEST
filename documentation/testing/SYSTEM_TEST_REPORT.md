## Security Concerns üî¥
### Critical Issues:
1. **Seed Phrase Exposure**
   - Multiple console.log statements expose mnemonic
   - Found in seed generation and import flows
   - **Risk**: High - sensitive data in browser console

2. **Debug Logging**
   - 243 console.log statements total
   - Some contain sensitive wallet data
   - **Recommendation**: Remove before production

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. ‚úÖ Remove all seed/mnemonic console.log statements
2. ‚úÖ Review and remove debug logging
3. ‚úÖ Add production build process to strip logs

### Next Phase:
1. Continue with AccountListModal implementation
2. Add account management features
3. Implement inline renaming
4. Add delete confirmation modal
