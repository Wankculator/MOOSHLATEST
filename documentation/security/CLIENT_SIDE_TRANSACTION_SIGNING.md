# Client-Side Transaction Signing Implementation

## Overview

MOOSH Wallet now implements **secure client-side transaction signing**, ensuring that private keys never leave the user's device. This is a critical security improvement that protects user funds from potential server compromises or network interceptions.

## Security Principles

### ✅ What We Do (Secure Approach)

1. **Private keys stay on client** - Never transmitted over network
2. **Transactions built locally** - Using UTXOs and recipient info
3. **Signing happens in browser** - Using bitcoinjs-lib
4. **Only signed hex sent** - Server only sees the final transaction

### ❌ What We Don't Do (Insecure Approach)

1. **Never send private keys to server**
2. **Never store private keys in API requests**
3. **Never log or debug private key data**
4. **Never trust server with signing**

## Implementation Details

### 1. Transaction Signer Service

Location: `/public/js/modules/services/transaction-signer.js`

Key Features:
- Builds PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction)
- Signs with user's private key locally
- Calculates optimal fee based on transaction size
- Handles change addresses
- Validates all inputs before signing

```javascript
// Example usage
const signer = new TransactionSigner();
const signedTx = await signer.createAndSignTransaction({
    from: senderAddress,
    to: recipientAddress,
    amount: amountSatoshis,
    feeRate: feeRatePerByte,
    privateKey: privateKeyObject, // Never sent to server!
    utxos: unspentOutputs,
    network: 'mainnet'
});
```

### 2. Updated Send Modal

Location: `/public/js/modules/modals/send-modal.js`

Changes:
- Fetches UTXOs from server (public data)
- Signs transaction client-side
- Sends only signed hex to server
- Shows transaction ID on success

### 3. New API Endpoints

#### GET /api/bitcoin/utxos/:address
- Returns unspent outputs for an address
- Public blockchain data only
- No authentication required

#### POST /api/bitcoin/broadcast
- Accepts signed transaction hex
- Broadcasts to Bitcoin network
- Returns transaction ID
- **Never sees private keys**

#### GET /api/bitcoin/transactions/:address
- Returns transaction history
- Public blockchain data
- Supports pagination

## Security Benefits

1. **Non-Custodial** - Server never has access to funds
2. **Network Security** - Private keys can't be intercepted
3. **Server Compromise** - Even if server is hacked, funds are safe
4. **Audit Trail** - All transactions verifiable on blockchain
5. **User Control** - Users maintain full control of keys

## Transaction Flow

```
1. User enters recipient and amount
   ↓
2. Client fetches UTXOs from server
   ↓
3. Client builds transaction locally
   ↓
4. Client signs with private key (never leaves browser!)
   ↓
5. Client sends only signed hex to server
   ↓
6. Server broadcasts to Bitcoin network
   ↓
7. Transaction ID returned to user
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Create a wallet and note the address
2. Click "Send" button
3. Enter recipient address and amount
4. Confirm transaction
5. Verify that transaction is signed locally
6. Check network tab - no private keys sent

### Security Testing
```bash
# Monitor network traffic
# Ensure no requests contain private keys
grep -i "private" network-log.har

# Check server logs
# Ensure no private keys are logged
grep -i "wif\|hex.*key" api-server.log
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Hardware Wallet Support** - Ledger, Trezor integration
2. **Multi-signature** - Require multiple signatures
3. **RBF Support** - Replace-by-fee for stuck transactions
4. **Batch Transactions** - Send to multiple recipients
5. **PSBT Export** - For offline signing

## Migration Notes

For existing implementations that may have insecure transaction signing:

1. **Identify** all places sending private keys
2. **Replace** with client-side signing
3. **Update** API endpoints to accept only signed transactions
4. **Test** thoroughly before deploying
5. **Monitor** for any legacy code

## Best Practices

1. **Always validate** addresses client-side
2. **Double-check** amounts and fees
3. **Show confirmations** before signing
4. **Clear sensitive data** from memory after use
5. **Use secure random** for any nonces

## Compliance

This implementation follows:
- BIP32 for HD wallets
- BIP39 for mnemonic seeds
- BIP174 for PSBT format
- Industry best practices for non-custodial wallets

## Conclusion

Client-side transaction signing is a fundamental security requirement for any cryptocurrency wallet. By implementing this properly, MOOSH Wallet ensures users maintain complete control over their funds while still providing a smooth user experience.
