# Secure Password Hashing Implementation

## Overview

MOOSH Wallet now implements **secure password hashing using PBKDF2** instead of the weak custom hash function. This provides cryptographically secure password storage that protects against rainbow table attacks and brute force attempts.

## Why This Matters

The previous implementation used a simple bit-shifting algorithm that was:
- ❌ Not cryptographically secure
- ❌ Vulnerable to rainbow tables
- ❌ No salt (same password = same hash)
- ❌ Too fast (easy to brute force)

The new implementation uses PBKDF2 which provides:
- ✅ Cryptographically secure hashing
- ✅ Unique salt for each password
- ✅ 100,000 iterations (slow by design)
- ✅ Protection against timing attacks

## Implementation Details

### 1. Password Service

Location: `/public/js/modules/services/password-service.js`

Key Features:
- **PBKDF2** with SHA-256
- **100,000 iterations** (OWASP recommended)
- **128-bit salt** (cryptographically random)
- **256-bit derived key**
- **Constant-time comparison** to prevent timing attacks

```javascript
// Example usage
const passwordService = new PasswordService();

// Hash a password
const { hash, salt } = await passwordService.hashPassword('userPassword123');

// Verify a password
const isValid = await passwordService.verifyPassword('userPassword123', hash, salt);
```

### 2. Password Strength Checking

The service includes password strength validation:
- Minimum 8 characters (12+ recommended)
- Character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Pattern detection (repeated characters, common sequences)
- Real-time feedback for users

### 3. Secure Password Generation

Generates cryptographically secure random passwords:
```javascript
const securePassword = passwordService.generateSecurePassword(16);
// Example: "Kx9!mP$2vL#4nQ7&"
```

### 4. Migration Support

Automatic migration from old weak hashes:
1. User enters password
2. System verifies against old hash
3. If valid, automatically re-hashes with PBKDF2
4. Old hash is replaced with secure version
5. Transparent to the user

## Security Benefits

1. **Brute Force Protection**
   - 100,000 iterations makes each guess expensive
   - Would take years to crack even weak passwords

2. **Rainbow Table Immunity**
   - Unique salt for each password
   - Pre-computed hashes are useless

3. **Timing Attack Protection**
   - Constant-time comparison
   - No information leaked through timing

4. **Future Proof**
   - Easy to increase iterations as hardware improves
   - Standard algorithm with wide support

## Browser Compatibility

PBKDF2 is available via Web Crypto API in all modern browsers:
- ✅ Chrome 37+
- ✅ Firefox 34+
- ✅ Safari 7.1+
- ✅ Edge (all versions)

## Why Not bcrypt?

While bcrypt is excellent for server-side applications, it's not available in browsers. PBKDF2 provides similar security benefits and is natively supported via Web Crypto API.

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Set a password in the wallet
2. Check sessionStorage - should see:
   - `moosh_wallet_pwd_hash` - The derived key
   - `moosh_wallet_pwd_salt` - The salt
   - `moosh_wallet_pwd_version` - Should be "2"

### Security Testing
```javascript
// Verify different passwords produce different hashes
const pwd1 = await passwordService.hashPassword('password123');
const pwd2 = await passwordService.hashPassword('password123');
console.log(pwd1.hash === pwd2.hash); // false (different salts)

// Verify same password with same salt produces same hash
const result = await passwordService.hashPassword('test', saltBuffer);
// Will produce consistent hash for verification
```

## Performance Considerations

PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations takes approximately:
- 50-100ms on modern desktops
- 100-200ms on mobile devices

This is intentional - the slowness is a security feature that makes brute force attacks impractical.

## Best Practices

1. **Never log passwords or hashes**
2. **Use sessionStorage, not localStorage** for password data
3. **Clear password data on logout**
4. **Implement password timeout** (15 minutes of inactivity)
5. **Show password strength indicator** to encourage strong passwords

## Migration Path

For existing users with weak password hashes:

1. **Version 1** (legacy) - Simple bit-shift hash
2. **Version 2** (current) - PBKDF2 with salt

The system automatically migrates passwords on next login:
- Detects version 1 hash
- Verifies password with legacy function
- Re-hashes with PBKDF2
- Updates to version 2

## Future Enhancements

1. **Argon2** support when available in browsers
2. **Configurable iteration count** based on device performance
3. **Password history** to prevent reuse
4. **Two-factor authentication** integration

## Conclusion

This implementation brings MOOSH Wallet's password security up to modern standards. Users' wallet passwords are now protected with industry-standard cryptographic hashing that would take impractical amounts of time and resources to crack.
