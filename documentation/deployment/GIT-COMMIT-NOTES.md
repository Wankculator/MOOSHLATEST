# Git Commit Notes - MOOSH Wallet Fixes

## Commit Title
Fix view mode buttons and update account name colors to match theme

## Changes Summary

### 1. Fixed View Mode Buttons (GRID, LIST, DETAILS)
**Issue**: User reported "GRID LIST DETAILS not functioning after pressing"
**Root Cause**: `updateAccountGrid()` method was looking for `.account-grid` class which was missing in LIST and DETAILS views
**Solution**: Added `className: 'account-grid'` to both `createListView` and `createDetailsView` methods

### 2. Updated Account Name Colors
**Issue**: Account names were displayed in white (#fff) which didn't match the wallet theme
**Solution**: Changed all account name displays to use orange theme color (#f57315):
- GRID view: Account card headers
- LIST view: Account name in rows  
- DETAILS view: Account name in table
