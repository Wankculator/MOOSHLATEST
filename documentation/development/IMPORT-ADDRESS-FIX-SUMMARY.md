# Import Address Generation Fix Summary

## Issue
When importing wallets, addresses were sometimes not displayed in the AccountListModal, showing "No addresses generated" even though the addresses were actually being generated by the API.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The API was returning addresses correctly
2. The addresses were being stored in the account object
3. The issue was related to:
   - Slow API responses timing out
   - UI not refreshing when addresses were populated later
   - Display logic looking for non-existent property (bech32 instead of segwit)

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Address Display Logic (Line 19005)
Changed from:
```javascript
account.addresses.bech32 || account.addresses.segwit || 'No addresses generated'
```
To:
```javascript
(account.addresses && (account.addresses.segwit || account.addresses.bitcoin || account.addresses.taproot || account.addresses.legacy)) 
    ? (account.addresses.segwit || account.addresses.bitcoin || account.addresses.taproot || account.addresses.legacy)
    : 'Loading addresses...'
```
- Now checks multiple address types as fallback
- Shows "Loading addresses..." instead of "No addresses generated"

### 2. Added Timeout Protection (Lines 2490-2514)
```javascript
const fetchWithTimeout = (url, options, timeout = 30000) => {
    return Promise.race([
        fetch(url, options),
        new Promise((_, reject) => 
            setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Request timeout')), timeout)
        )
    ]);
};
```
- Prevents infinite hanging on slow API responses
- 30-second timeout for address generation

### 3. Improved Logging (Lines 2584-2589)
- Replaced console.log with ComplianceUtils.log
- Added detailed logging for each address type
- Shows [OK] or [X] indicators for each address

### 4. Auto-Fix Missing Addresses (Lines 2613-2632)
```javascript
if (!hasAllAddresses) {
    ComplianceUtils.log('StateManager', 'Some addresses are missing, scheduling auto-fix', 'warn');
    setTimeout(() => {
        this.fixMissingAddresses().then(fixedCount => {
            if (fixedCount > 0) {
                ComplianceUtils.log('StateManager', `Fixed ${fixedCount} accounts with missing addresses`);
                this.emit('accounts', this.state.accounts);
            }
        });
    }, 2000);
}
```
- Automatically detects missing addresses after import
- Schedules fixMissingAddresses to run after 2 seconds
- Emits event to trigger UI updates

### 5. Added Event Listener for Live Updates (Lines 18050-18057)
```javascript
this.accountUpdateHandler = () => {
    ComplianceUtils.log('AccountListModal', 'Accounts updated, refreshing display');
    if (this.modal) {
        this.updateAccountGrid();
    }
};
this.app.state.on('accounts', this.accountUpdateHandler);
```
- AccountListModal now listens for account updates
- Automatically refreshes the display when addresses are populated

### 6. Cleanup on Close (Lines 19788-19792)
```javascript
if (this.accountUpdateHandler) {
    this.app.state.off('accounts', this.accountUpdateHandler);
    this.accountUpdateHandler = null;
}
```
- Properly removes event listener to prevent memory leaks

## Testing
Created `test-import-address-generation.html` to verify:
- Direct API import works correctly
- StateManager createAccount properly stores addresses
- UI updates when addresses are populated
- Known test seed generates expected addresses

## Result
The import address generation bug is now fixed. Addresses will:
1. Display immediately if available
2. Show "Loading addresses..." while being fetched
3. Automatically populate when ready
4. Trigger UI refresh when updated

## Remaining Task
The only pending task is to fix the package.json module type warning, which is a minor issue that doesn't affect functionality.
