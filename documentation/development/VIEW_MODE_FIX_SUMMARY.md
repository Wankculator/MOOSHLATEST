# View Mode Buttons Fix Summary

## Issue Reported
User reported: "GRID LIST DETAILS not functioning after pressing"

## Root Cause Analysis
The `updateAccountGrid()` method was looking for an element with class `.account-grid` to replace when switching views. However:
- The GRID view had `className: 'account-grid'` 
- The LIST view was missing this className
- The DETAILS view was missing this className

This caused the view switching to fail because `updateAccountGrid()` couldn't find the element to replace.

## Fix Applied
Added `className: 'account-grid'` to both `createListView` and `createDetailsView` methods:

```javascript
// Before (broken):
return $.div({
    style: {
        flex: '1',
        overflow: 'auto',
        padding: '20px'
    }
}, [

// After (fixed):
return $.div({
    className: 'account-grid',  // Added this line
    style: {
        flex: '1',
        overflow: 'auto',
        padding: '20px'
    }
}, [
```
