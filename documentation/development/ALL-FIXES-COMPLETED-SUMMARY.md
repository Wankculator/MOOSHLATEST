# MOOSH Wallet - All Fixes Completed Summary

## Overview
All critical issues in the MOOSH Wallet have been successfully fixed. The application is now fully functional with real-time Bitcoin price data, proper address generation on import, and consistent UI elements.

## Fixes Completed

### 1. [HIGH] Fixed Fake BTC Price Data
**Issue**: Dashboard showing hardcoded $45,000 instead of real prices
**Fix**: 
- Implemented real API calls to CoinGecko (primary) and blockchain.info (fallback)
- Added 5-minute caching to reduce API calls
- Falls back to last known price on API failure
- All hardcoded values replaced with dynamic data

### 2. [HIGH] Fixed Syntax Error at Line 26904
**Issue**: Missing closing brace in renderMiniPriceChart method
**Fix**: Added missing `}` after forEach loop

### 3. [HIGH] Fixed debouncedUpdateLiveData Function Error
**Issue**: Function called during render but created in afterMount
**Fix**: Added constructor to DashboardPage that creates the function early

### 4. [MEDIUM] Fixed Logo 404 Errors
**Issue**: App looking for moosh-logo.svg but file was Moosh-logo.png
**Fix**: Updated all 11 references in code and manifest.json

### 5. [HIGH] Fixed Balance Display Inconsistency
**Issue**: Chart showing $0.00 while main display showed correct balance
**Fix**: 
- Removed code treating small balances as "fake data"
- Added chart refresh after balance updates
- Ensured consistent data source

### 6. [HIGH] Fixed Currency Selector UI Mismatch
**Issue**: Currency selector in manage wallet didn't match dashboard styling
**Fix**: Made AccountListModal currency selector theme-aware (orange/green based on mode)

### 7. [HIGH] Fixed Import Address Generation Bug
**Issue**: Addresses sometimes not displayed after import
**Fix**:
- Enhanced address display logic with multiple fallbacks
- Added 30-second timeout protection for API calls
- Implemented auto-fix for missing addresses
- Added event listeners for UI refresh
- Improved error handling and logging

### 8. [MEDIUM] Fixed Package.json Module Type Warning

**Fix**: Added `"type": "module"` to /src/server/package.json
