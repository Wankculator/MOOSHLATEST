# Account Switcher Fix

## Issue
The AccountSwitcher dropdown is not showing when clicked.

## Root Cause
The dropdown was using conditional rendering with `this.state.isOpen &&` which can cause issues with event handling and DOM updates.

## Fix Applied

1. **Changed to CSS-based visibility control**
   - Dropdown is always rendered but hidden with `display: none`
   - When open, it shows with `display: block`

2. **Added proper event handling**
   - Added `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` to click handler
   - Prevents event bubbling issues

3. **Added debugging logs**
   - ComplianceUtils.log shows when dropdown is toggled
   - Helps track state changes

4. **Improved z-index**
   - Set parent container z-index to 100
   - Set dropdown z-index to 10000 to ensure it's on top

## Testing Steps

1. Open the dashboard
2. Look for the account name button (left of "Manage" button)
3. Click it - you should see console logs about toggling
4. The dropdown should appear below the button
5. Click outside to close it

## If Still Not Working

Check browser console for:
- Any JavaScript errors
- The toggle log messages
- Whether accounts exist in state

You can also inspect the element to see if the dropdown is rendered but hidden behind other elements.
