# BTC Price Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. [OK] Syntax Error at Line 26904
**Problem**: Missing closing brace for forEach loop at line 26885
**Solution**: Added missing `}` to properly close the if statement
**Status**: FIXED

### 2. [OK] Fake BTC Price Data
**Problem**: Dashboard showing hardcoded $45,000 price
**Solution**: 
- Removed all hardcoded price values
- Implemented real-time price fetching from CoinGecko API
- Added fallback to blockchain.info API
- Stores last known price for offline/error scenarios

### 3. [OK] Compliance Issues
**Problem**: Not following CLAUDE.md coding standards
**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Logging**: Replaced all console.log/error with ComplianceUtils.log
- **Debouncing**: Added 300ms debounce to updateLiveData
- **Performance**: Wrapped fetchBitcoinPrice with measurePerformance
- **Error Handling**: Proper try-catch with meaningful fallbacks
- **Validation**: Added API response validation
- **Caching**: 5-minute cache + localStorage for last known price

## Code Changes

### APIService.fetchBitcoinPrice (Lines 2797-2901)

- Added debounced version of updateLiveData

## Testing

Created comprehensive test files:
- `test-btc-price-complete.html` - Full compliance test suite
- `test-btc-price-init.html` - Dashboard initialization test

## Notes on Other Errors

The console errors from contentScript.js are from browser extensions (likely password managers or ad blockers) and are NOT related to MOOSH wallet code. These can be safely ignored.

The favicon.ico 404 error should not occur as the file exists in /public/favicon.ico. If it persists, it may be a caching issue.

## Verification Steps

1. Reload http://localhost:3333
2. Check dashboard shows real BTC price (not $45,000)
3. Balance calculations use real price
4. Price updates every 30 seconds
5. No syntax errors in console
6. Debouncing prevents rapid API calls
