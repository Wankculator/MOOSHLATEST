## 🎯 **SECTION 6: ADVANCED WALLET PATTERNS**

### **🏗️ Wallet Architecture Patterns**

#### **State Management Pattern**
```javascript
// Sabrina-approved wallet state management
class WalletStateManager {
  constructor() {
    this.state = new Map();
    this.listeners = new Set();
  }

  // Follow C-4: Simple, composable, testable functions
  updateWalletBalance(walletId, balance) {
    this.validateWalletId(walletId);
    this.validateBalance(balance);
    
    const currentState = this.getWalletState(walletId);
    const newState = { ...currentState, balance };
    
    this.setState(walletId, newState);
    this.notifyListeners(walletId, newState);
  }

  // Follow C-10: Always validate inputs
  validateWalletId(walletId) {
    if (!walletId || typeof walletId !== 'string') {
      throw new Error('Invalid wallet ID');
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Security Pattern**
```javascript
// Sabrina-approved wallet security pattern
class WalletSecurityManager {
  // Follow S-1: Never log sensitive data
  createWallet(seedPhrase) {
    // Validate input without logging
    this.validateSeedPhrase(seedPhrase);
    
    try {
      const wallet = this.generateWallet(seedPhrase);
      
      // Log success without sensitive data
      this.logger.info('Wallet created successfully', {
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        walletId: wallet.id // Only log non-sensitive ID
      });
      
      return wallet;
    } catch (error) {
      // Follow S-5: Don't leak sensitive info in errors
      this.logger.error('Wallet creation failed', {
        error: error.message,
        timestamp: Date.now()
      });
      throw new Error('Wallet creation failed');
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Testing Pattern**
```javascript
// Sabrina-approved wallet testing pattern
describe('WalletManager', () => {
  // Follow T-6: Test entire structure in one assertion
  test('should create wallet with complete state', () => {
    const mockSeedPhrase = 'test seed phrase';
    const wallet = walletManager.createWallet(mockSeedPhrase);
    
    expect(wallet).toEqual({
      id: expect.any(String),
      address: expect.any(String),
      balance: 0,
      transactions: [],
      createdAt: expect.any(Number)
    });
  });

  // Follow T-3: Separate pure logic from network tests
  test('should validate wallet address format', () => {
    const address = 'bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh';
    const isValid = walletManager.validateAddress(address);
    
    expect(isValid).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

## 🎯 **SECTION 9: SABRINA'S ADVANCED TECHNIQUES**

### **🧠 Cognitive Load Management**

#### **Breaking Down Complex Wallet Features**
```
When implementing complex wallet features:

1. **Decompose** the feature into smaller, manageable pieces
2. **Prioritize** core functionality first
3. **Implement** incrementally with testing at each step
4. **Validate** each piece before moving to the next
5. **Integrate** carefully with existing systems

Example: Implementing a multi-signature wallet
- Phase 1: Basic multi-sig address generation
- Phase 2: Transaction creation and signing
- Phase 3: Signature collection and verification
- Phase 4: UI integration and user experience
- Phase 5: Security hardening and testing
```

#### **Context Management**
```
To maintain Claude's context effectively:

1. **Start each session** with `/clear` and `qnew`
2. **Reference specific files** and line numbers
3. **Paste relevant code** when asking for changes
4. **Use consistent terminology** throughout the session
5. **Break long sessions** into focused chunks
```

### **⚡ Rapid Prototyping Techniques**

#### **Quick Wallet Feature Validation**
```
For rapid wallet feature validation:

1. **Create minimal implementation** focusing on core logic
2. **Add basic UI** using ElementFactory patterns
3. **Test core functionality** manually
4. **Gather feedback** from stakeholders
5. **Iterate quickly** based on feedback
6. **Polish and productionize** once validated
```

#### **Progressive Enhancement**
```
Build wallet features progressively:

1. **Core functionality** - Basic feature working
2. **Error handling** - Proper error management
3. **Security** - Security best practices
4. **UI/UX** - User experience optimization
5. **Performance** - Speed and efficiency
6. **Documentation** - User and developer docs
```
