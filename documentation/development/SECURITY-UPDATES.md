# MOOSH Wallet Security Updates

## Critical Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Private Key Security
**Issue**: Private keys were being stored in application state and logged to console
**Fix**: 
- Removed all private key storage from state (Line 2569)
- Private keys now only exist in memory when explicitly needed for transactions
- No private keys are persisted anywhere

### 2. Secure Storage Implementation
**File**: `/public/js/secure-storage.js`
**Features**:
- AES-256-GCM encryption for all sensitive data
- PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- Random IV for each encryption operation
- Password verification system
- Secure salt storage

### 3. Sensitive Data Logging Removed
**Changes**:
- Replaced all console.log statements that could expose seeds/keys
- Now using ComplianceUtils.log with sanitized output
- No mnemonic phrases or private keys are ever logged

### 4. Seed Storage Migration
**Implementation**:
- Detects unencrypted seeds in localStorage
- Prompts user to set password for encryption
- Migrates seeds to encrypted storage
- Clears unencrypted data after migration

## Security Best Practices Enforced

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- Required for wallet unlock
- Used for all encryption operations
- Never stored in plain text

### Key Derivation
- PBKDF2 with SHA-256
- 100,000 iterations
- Unique salt per wallet
- Prevents rainbow table attacks

### Data Handling
- No sensitive data in URLs
- No sensitive data in state
- No sensitive data in logs
- Encrypted storage only

## Migration Process

When users open the wallet with existing unencrypted seeds:
1. System detects unencrypted data
2. Prompts for password creation
3. Encrypts existing seeds
4. Removes unencrypted data
5. All future operations use encrypted storage

## API Security
- 30-second timeout on all API calls
- No private keys sent to API
- Local key derivation only
- Secure random generation

## Remaining Security Considerations

### Future Improvements
1. Hardware wallet integration
2. Multi-signature support
3. Biometric authentication
4. Session timeout controls
5. 2FA for critical operations
