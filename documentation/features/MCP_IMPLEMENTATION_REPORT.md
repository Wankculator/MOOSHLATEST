### 4. Context7 MCP âœ… (New Implementation)
**Location**: `/mcp-servers/context7/`

**Purpose**: Advanced code context management and impact analysis

**Features**:
- **Codebase Analysis**: Analyzes entire project structure
- **Dependency Graph**: Builds complete dependency relationships
- **Impact Analysis**: Calculates change impact across files
- **Critical File Detection**: Identifies high-impact modules
- **Circular Dependency Detection**: Finds problematic dependencies

**Key Capabilities**:
```javascript
// Get file context
const context = context7.getFileContext('public/js/moosh-wallet.js');

// Analyze change impact
const impact = context7.getChangeImpact(['api-service.js', 'state-manager.js']);

// Generate comprehensive report
const report = context7.generateReport();
```

**Sample Output**:
```
Summary:
  Total Files: 138
  Total Dependencies: 30
  Critical Files: 10
  Circular Dependencies: 0

Top Critical Files:
  - state-manager.js (3 dependents, score: 100)
  - api-service.js (2 dependents, score: 70)
```

### 5. Firecrawl MCP âœ… (New Implementation)
**Location**: `/mcp-servers/firecrawl/`

**Purpose**: Web scraping for external data integration

**Features**:
- **Ordinals Data Scraping**: Inscription metadata and content
- **Blockchain Explorer Integration**: Transaction and address data
- **Market Data Collection**: Real-time price and volume data
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects API limits
- **Caching**: Reduces redundant requests

**Supported Sources**:
- Ordinals: ordinals.com, ord.io
- Blockchain: mempool.space, blockstream.info
- Market: CoinGecko API

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Scrape ordinals data
node mcp-servers/firecrawl/index.js ordinals <inscription-id>

# Get blockchain data
node mcp-servers/firecrawl/index.js blockchain tx <txid>

# Fetch market data
node mcp-servers/firecrawl/index.js market bitcoin
```

- Render performance tracking
- API response time analysis
- Bundle size monitoring

### 7. Code Quality Scanner MCP
**Purpose**: Code style and quality enforcement
- Naming convention validation
- Complexity metrics
- Documentation coverage
- Best practices enforcement

### 8. Dependency Auditor MCP
**Purpose**: Package security and compliance
- Vulnerability scanning
- License compliance checking
- Update recommendations
- Supply chain security

### 9. Test Coverage Reporter MCP
**Purpose**: Testing metrics and coverage
- Line coverage analysis
- Branch coverage tracking
- Function coverage reports
- Test quality metrics

### 10. API Monitor MCP
**Location**: `/mcp-servers/api-monitor/`
**Purpose**: API endpoint monitoring and optimization

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-commit Validation
```bash
# Run all MCPs before committing
npm run mcp:validate-all
```

### Continuous Monitoring
```bash
# Watch mode for real-time validation
npm run mcp:watch
```

### Individual MCP Execution
```bash
# Run specific MCPs
node scripts/test-with-sprite.js        # TestSprite
node scripts/check-memory.js            # Memory MCP
node scripts/check-security.js          # Security MCP
node mcp-servers/context7/index.js     # Context7
node mcp-servers/firecrawl/index.js    # Firecrawl
```

## MCP Validation Results

All MCPs are now integrated and passing:

```
ðŸ“‹ Running: TestSprite
âœ… TestSprite: PASSED

ðŸ“‹ Running: Memory Check
âœ… Memory Check: PASSED

ðŸ“‹ Running: Security Scan
âœ… Security Scan: PASSED

ðŸ“‹ Running: Context7 MCP
âœ… Context7 MCP: PASSED

ðŸ“‹ Running: Firecrawl MCP
âœ… Firecrawl MCP: PASSED
```

## Benefits Realized

### 1. Code Quality
- Automated compliance checking
- Consistent code standards
- Early error detection

### 2. Performance
- Memory leak prevention
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Optimization recommendations

### 3. Security
- Vulnerability detection
- Secure coding enforcement
- API security validation

### 4. Maintainability

## Usage Philosophy

As stated in CLAUDE.md:
> "We are using EVERY MCP available because we have Claude Opus 4 - implementation should be FAST and COMPREHENSIVE"

All MCPs work together to ensure:
- âœ… Code quality remains high
- âœ… Security vulnerabilities are caught early
- âœ… Performance issues are identified
- âœ… External data is integrated safely
- âœ… Development velocity is maintained
