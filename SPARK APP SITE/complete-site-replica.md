### **Complete Manifesto - Spark's Vision**
```
The Problem:
- Bitcoin succeeded as a monetary asset (decentralized store of value)
- Failed to become medium of exchange at scale
- Transactions are slow (30 minutes) and expensive
- Lightning proved fast/cheap possible but has UX/liquidity barriers
- Stablecoins succeeded by solving real problems (stability, instant settlement)
- Stablecoins became functional financial rails, moving more value than PayPal
- But stablecoin activity doesn't occur on Bitcoin due to limited expressiveness

The Solution - Spark:
- Bitcoin-native Layer 2 for payments and settlement
- No bridges, no custodians, only lightweight signing protocol
- Returns to first principles enabling native applications on Bitcoin
- Delivers best UX ever seen on Bitcoin
- Unlocks stablecoins directly on Bitcoin as native, scalable assets

Vision:
- Make digital cash (BTC or stablecoin) truly usable
- Fastest, simplest, cheapest rails in crypto
- Built by payment and Bitcoin veterans
- Designed to unlock Bitcoin's fullest potential
```

### **Technical Architecture Deep Dive**

#### **Shared Signing Protocol**
```
How It Works:
- Operates on top of Statechains
- Uses distributed ledger architecture
- Introduces Spark Operators (SOs) as signing participants
- SOs cannot move funds without users
- Users are required participants in any transfer
- On L1: Appears as chain of multi-sigs secured by users and SOs
- On L2: Operates as tree structure mapping transaction history and balances
- Maintains 1/n trust assumptions or minority/n depending on setup

Security Model:
- Maximum possible trustlessness for a Bitcoin scaling solution
- Native to Bitcoin with no external dependencies
- Open source implementation
- Unilateral exit always available depending only on Bitcoin
```

#### **Development SDKs**

##### **SparkWallet SDK**
```typescript
import { SparkWallet } from "@buildonspark/spark-sdk";

// Initialize wallet
const { wallet, mnemonic } = await SparkWallet.initialize({
  options: {
    network: "MAINNET", // or "TESTNET"
  },
});

// Generate deposit address
const depositAddress = await wallet.getSingleUseDepositAddress();

// Claim L1 deposit
const result = await getLatestDepositTxId(depositAddress);
if (result) {
  const tx = await wallet.claimDeposit(result);
}

// Check balance
const balance = await wallet.getBalance();

// Send payment
const payment = await wallet.sendPayment({
  amount: 1000, // sats
  destination: "destination_address"
});

// Lightning operations
const invoice = await wallet.createLightningInvoice(1000);
const payment = await wallet.payLightningInvoice(invoice);
```
