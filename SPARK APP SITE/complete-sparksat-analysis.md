## Executive Summary

**SparkSat** is a web-based Bitcoin wallet application built on the **Spark Protocol** - a revolutionary Layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin that enables instant, near-zero cost transactions while maintaining Bitcoin's security guarantees. Unlike traditional Layer 2 solutions, Spark operates natively on Bitcoin without bridges, wrapping, or external consensus mechanisms.

### Key Value Propositions:
- **Instant transactions** (<1 second settlement)
- **Near-zero fees** (virtually no transaction costs)
- **Self-custodial** (your keys, your coins)
- **Lightning compatible** (seamless Lightning Network integration)
- **Native Bitcoin tokens** (stablecoins and other assets directly on Bitcoin)
- **Minimal trust model** (1/n trust assumptions)
- **Always-open exit** (unilateral exit to Bitcoin L1)

## Spark Protocol Deep Dive

### Core Technology Stack

**Spark is NOT:**
- A traditional blockchain
- A rollup
- A sidechain with bridges
- A smart contract platform

**Spark IS:**
- A **Statechain-based** Layer 2 solution
- A **shared signing protocol** on top of Bitcoin
- A **distributed ledger** without external consensus
- A **payments-focused architecture** for instant settlement

### Technical Foundation

**Built on Statechains:**
Spark leverages Bitcoin Statechains technology to enable off-chain transactions while maintaining on-chain security guarantees. The protocol operates as a tree structure mapping transaction history and balances in real-time.

**FROST Signing Protocol:**
Spark employs a customized FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signing scheme that enables:
- **Threshold signing** for Spark Operators (t-of-n multisig)
- **Mandatory user participation** in all transactions
- **Single Schnorr signatures** for Bitcoin compatibility
- **Key tweakability** for advanced functionality
- **Additive aggregatability** for complex operations

---

## Technical Architecture

### Network Participants

**1. Users**
- Hold individual private keys
- Required participants in all transactions
- Can exit unilaterally to Bitcoin L1
- Maintain full custody of funds

**2. Spark Operators (SOs)**
- Distributed signing entities (typically t-of-n threshold)
- Help facilitate transactions but cannot move funds alone
- Must "forget" keys after transfers for forward security
- Provide network liveness and transaction coordination

**3. Spark Entity (SE)**
- Collection of Spark Operators working together
- Implements threshold signing protocols
- Ensures network availability and reliability

### Transaction Flow

**How Transactions Work:**

1. **Initiation:** User submits transaction request to coordinator
2. **Participant Selection:** Coordinator selects t participating SOs
3. **Nonce Generation:** All participants generate cryptographic nonces
4. **SO Signature Shares:** Each SO computes partial signature using FROST
5. **Aggregation:** Coordinator combines SO signature shares
6. **User Signature:** User computes final signature component
7. **Settlement:** Transaction settles instantly on Spark L2

**Key Innovation:** Transactions work by "delegating ownership" of on-chain UTXOs between parties through the shared signing protocol, similar to Lightning but with operator assistance.

### Security Model

**Trust Assumptions:**
- **1/n trust model:** Only one honest operator needed for security
- **Moment-in-time trust:** Trust only required during transaction
- **Perfect forward security:** Past transactions secure even if operators compromised
- **Non-custodial:** Users always retain ultimate control

**Exit Mechanisms:**
- **Pre-signed transactions** created before deposit
- **Timelocked exits** with decrementing delays
- **Unilateral exits** possible if operators disappear
- **Watchtower support** for automated monitoring

## How SparkSat Works

### User Journey

**1. Wallet Creation**
```
User → SparkSat Interface → Generate Keys → Backup Seed → Secure Wallet
```

**2. Deposit Flow**
```
Bitcoin L1 → Generate Deposit Address → Fund Wallet → Claim on Spark L2
```

**3. Transaction Flow**
```
User → Select Recipient → Sign Transaction → Operator Coordination → Instant Settlement
```

**4. Lightning Integration**
```
Spark Transaction → Lightning Gateway → Lightning Network → Final Destination
```

### Code Integration Example

```javascript
import { SparkWallet } from "@buildonspark/spark-sdk";

  },
});

// Generate deposit address
const depositAddress = await wallet.getSingleUseDepositAddress();

// Claim deposit from L1
const result = await getLatestDepositTxId(depositAddress);
if (result) {
  const tx = await wallet.claimDeposit(result);
  console.log("Deposit TX: ", tx);
}

// Check balance
const balance = await wallet.getBalance();

// Send payment
const payment = await wallet.send({
  to: "recipient_address",
  amount: 1000, // satoshis
});
```
